*More lint tools == Harder to manage/standardize*

* The problem we had

** No config standard

* The problem we had

** No config standard

- Remove new lines?

- Vertical alignment?

- Warn about deprecated or just info about it?

- Outdated linter versions in some projects

* The problem we had

** No standard between different editors

- How handle different editors? Emacs, VScode, Vim, Intellij

- How avoid local configs in each dev machines?
